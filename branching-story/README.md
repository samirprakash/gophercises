# Exercise Details

Create a program that lets a user iterate through a story based on its choice. This is an advancement on the linear approach where the user was forced to moved in one direction based on how the story was defined by the writer.

In this program, user can choose at each point in the story from a set of options which decide where the story is going to proceed. 

While the linear story was an implementation of a linked list, the branching story would explore the concepts around trees.
