# Exercise details

Create a program that will interact with the user and ask them to guess a number between 1 and 100. 

The program will guess a number and provide the answer to the user. User can then choose from the three available options. Either the guess made by the program was too high, or too low or the guess was correct.

Based on what the user chooses from the givedn option the program should repsond accordingly. If the user said that the guess was too high from what the user's selected number, then the program should compute and provide another guess. The same flow should work in case if the program guesses a number which is lower than the value that the user has thought about. Program exits when the user verifies that the program has guessed the number correctly.

This is going to be a liner flow program initially.

# Additional improvements
* Use a search algorithm to reduce the number of guesses made by the program
* Make the program print out how many guesses were required to find the correct answer
* Find out if the user is cheating
